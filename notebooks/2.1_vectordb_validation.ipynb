This can be fairly simple with a precise user input question like \"pull from x schema\" or more unique keywords. But it can also be very tough. In the first version of this, I have a pure vectordb similarity search. I want to test how accurately this get the correct schema in the top 1 and top 3. If it's not satisfactory - I want to then move onto testing other options or ways to supplement it.\n",
