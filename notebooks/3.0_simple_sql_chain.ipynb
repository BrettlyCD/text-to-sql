    "\n",
    "My takeaway from a few weeks of learning langchain is that it's very cool. In this notebook, I test the \"out-of-the-box\" SQL Database Chain.\n",
    "\n",
    "This takes a specified llm model, database, and a prompt template (which the langchain peeps have created as a standard) and runs through a chain. This chain feeds in the table info from the tables in the database and prompts the LLM to answer an input quesiton using that info. It writes a SQL, runs it against the database, and then answers the question for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "For my workflow, I don't know which database to use yet. That's were the vector database we created comes in. Using a similarity search, I want to pull down the most likely schema and table and save the metadata as variables. Then will take the standard langchain prompt template and tweak it slightly to enter the model. With this simple first test, I'll make it a specific chain with only one table required to answer the question, whch I'll feed to to model directly."

    "This continues to be inconsistent at best. In this case it created a working query, but the wrong one. Part of this could be the capability of the model itself. But even with some testing on chat GPT 3.5 online, it doesn't always work to just load in ALL of the table information. So we need to try to make the prompt better and maybe even guide the model through some steps. So next I will explore the SQL Database Sequential Chain."
